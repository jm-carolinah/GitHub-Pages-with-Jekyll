## About Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages and a simplified build process. Jekyll takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a complete static website based on your choice of layouts. Jekyll supports Markdown and Liquid, a templating language that loads dynamic content on your site. For more information, see [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Jekyll is not officially supported for Windows. For more information, see "[Jekyll on Windows](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation)" in the Jekyll documentation.

We recommend using Jekyll with GitHub Pages. If you prefer, you can use other static site generators or customize your own build process locally or on another server. For more information, see "[About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/about-github-pages#static-site-generators)."
